# Basic_OnShape_CAD
Basic CAD from OnShape.
## Base
### Assignment
Contruct the base for the Caster in OnShape.

### Refelction
The base is a pretty is part in my opinion but it was somewhat harder this time due to the new CAD program, but I think it will get better from this point forward.

## Mount
### Assignment
Construct the Mount Part for the Caster in OnShape.

### Reflection
Like I said in the last reflection it is only going to get easier, the more I use it the better I'll be with OnShape. That is the only thing that is a problem.

## Fork
### Assignment
Create the Fork part for the Caster assembly in OnShape CAD.
### Image

### Reflection
This assignment was a little bit harder than the others because we had to do somethings that I forgot how to do.

## Tire
### Assignment
Create the Tire for the Wheel of the Caster in OnShape.
### Image

### Reflection
This Assignment was probably the easiest of the ones we have had, because the only thting you need to do is make a trapzoid and revolve it around an axis and you are done.

## Wheel 
### Assignment
Construct the Wheel fro the Caster in OnShape.
### Image

### Reflection
This assignment was a little bit more challenging than the others but still not to difficult. The Assembly might be a little bit harder then usual due to not having done an assebly in OnShape before.

### Reflection
This assignment was a little challenging mostly because it was just alot of stuff not a lot of hard things to do just the amount of different pieces was a little challenging.

## Sub-Assembly
### Assignment
Construct the sub-assembly in OnShape before finishing the final caster assembly.
### Image
![Sub-Assembly_Caster](images/Sub-AssemblyCaster.png)
### Reflection
I would have to say that this was one of the harder assignments solely because it was my first time doing an assembly in OnShape and I had to learn how to do it, which made it hard but still not incredibly difficult.

## Final Caster
### Assignment
Complete the final Caster assembly in OnShape.
### Image
![Final_Caster](images/FinalCaster.png)
### Reflection
This final assembly was kind of difficult bcause there were some new thing that I had to learn that I hadn't done before in OnShape, like getting all of the mates correct Because at one point my axle was off-centered just by a tiny bit, but it made it so I had to go  back and fix it in the sub-assembly. Also learnig how to implement screws, bolts and nuts was not super easy, due to having to do it on a new syestem.

### Assignment
Create a frame using configurations of two parts, the frame and the pins.
### Image

![PictureFrame](images/PictureFrame.PNG)
### Reflection
This assignment was harder than the past assignments due to the fact that I had to guess on some of the measurements, because I was not given all of them. It was also a learning expierence to learn how to use configurations in OnShape.
